# Streaming IoT data to Google Cloud Storage

In this simulated project, I will configure Cloud IoT Core and Cloud Pub/Sub to create a Pub/Sub topic and registry on GCP. I will use this topic to ingest data streaming from an IoT device.

### Goal for this project
- Create Cloud Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions
- Use IoT Core to create a registry
- Start the MQTT Application on a simulator
- Stream data to Google Cloud Storage
